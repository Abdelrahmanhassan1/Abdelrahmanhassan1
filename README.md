Biomedical Engineer from Cairo University Faculty Of Engineering.
I started my career in programming 5 years ago.
I learned C++ and java and this was my first step to dive into programming.
Now I am a Python Developer and enthusiast in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
So I started Learning Data analysis and yet I finished a Nano Degree from Udacity.
I also Learned Web Development and got a course to become a full-stack web developer, and for my interest in Mobile applications, I learned to Flutter and build some apps you can check on my Github.
